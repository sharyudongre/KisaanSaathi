A chatbot that can assist farmers with weed management

Weeds are unwanted plants that compete for nutrients, space, light, and exerts a lot of harmful effects by reducing the quality as well as quantity of the crop.
Weeds may reduce about 40-50% grain yield in wheat crops. Among the factors, which adversely affect the yield of the wheat crop, weed infestation is the most harmful one.
As a result, Every year, due to crop failure, many Indian farmers commit suicide. As of 2014, in Maharashtra alone, more than 60000 suicides had taken place, with an average of 160 suicides every day. Unfortunately, farming issues such as weeds were considered the top reason.
Thus to address this alarming situation, we have come up with an idea to create an intelligent chatbot that can assist our farmers by providing suggestions and solutions to agricultural problems.
Chatbots are nothing but the conversational virtual assistants which automate interactions with end-users. Our model has been trained on the KCC(Kisan Call center) dataset using Natural language processing. It will be further optimized using ML and AI techniques using Pytorch which will enable farmers to understand natural language and interact in a more personalized way.
